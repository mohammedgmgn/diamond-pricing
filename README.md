# Diamond Pricing

Analysis of retail diamond pricing dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds. Data relationships are investigated in the first part. Based on that analysis, prices are predicted with linear regression and descision tree regression models. Ensembling is used to improve prediction quality.

* See the [diamond-pricing](diamond-pricing.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for analysis.
